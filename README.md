# Remote Sensing Image Classification using CNN-CapsNet for EECS 442 final class project

This project replicates a VGG-16-based CNN-CapsNet satellite image classification as proposed in [the study of W Zhang et al. (2019)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/5/494) using the UCMerced Land Use dataset. Achieving an accuracy of 95.52% on the validation dataset.
