# Remote Sensing Image Classification using CNN-CapsNet

**[Read the project report (PDF)](./report.pdf) • [Code](./train.py)**

This project replicates a VGG-16-based CNN-CapsNet satellite image classification as proposed in the [study of W Zhang et al. (2019)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/5/494) using the UCMerced Land Use dataset. Achieving an accuracy of 95.52% on the validation dataset. It was led by me and completed as the final class project for [EECS 442 Computer Vision](https://eecs442.github.io/) at the University of Michigan

## Dataset
This project uses the [UC Merced Land Use Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulhasibuddin/uc-merced-land-use-dataset).

Download the dataset manually and place it in a folder named `UCMerced_LandUse/` at the project root.

## Model Storage
The trained model will be saved in a folder named `models/` at the project root.
