# Remote Sensing Image Classification using CNN-CapsNet for EECS 442 final class project

This project replicates a VGG-based CNN-CapsNet satellite image classification as proposed in [the study of W Zhang et al. (2019)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/5/494) using the UCMerced Land Use dataset.

## Dataset
This project uses the [UC Merced Land Use Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulhasibuddin/uc-merced-land-use-dataset).

Download the dataset manually and place it in a folder named `UCMerced_LandUse/` at the project root.

## Trained Model
The trained model will be saved in a folder named `models/` at the project root.
